# Cheat Mode

Cheat Mode is a mod that gives players an easy way to access the creative inventory from the survival mode,
as well as some nice options. Since versions 2.0.0+ these can be changed in the **chat screen**.

Opening the creative inventory in survival mode only works on servers where the player has **gamemode permissions**.

### Options
- Instantly Open Inv: when turned on opening the survival inventory will instantly open the creative inventory, 
otherwise there will be a button (grass block) in the survival inventory to open it.
- Flight: When turned on the player is able to fly in survival mode.
- Reach: Change the player reach (attacking entities and placing/breaking blocks) (default: 3.0) (values above about 5.0 aren't effective on servers).
